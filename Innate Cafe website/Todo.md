I’d like us to start with a small test project so we can see how your skills are growing.
Build a 1-page website for a small client. You can pick one:
1. Local shop
2. Tuition/school
3. café.
It should have:
* A heading (business name)
* A short paragraph about what they do
* A simple contact form (name, email, message)

Keep it simple, clean, and use proper HTML structure. You can add *basic styling if you like.

Deadline: 2 days.
